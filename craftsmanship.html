  Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship

<h2>
Raising the bar.
</h2>

<p>
  As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar
  of professional software development by practicing it
  and helping others learn the craft. Through this work
  we have come to value:
</p>

<ul class='values'>
  <li>
    <p>
      Not only working software,
    </p>
    <p>
      but also
      <strong>well-crafted software</strong>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Not only responding to change,
    </p>
    <p>
      but also
      <strong>steadily adding value</strong>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Not only individuals and interactions,
    </p>
    <p>
      but also
      <strong>a community of professionals</strong>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Not only customer collaboration,
    </p>
    <p>
      but also
      <strong>productive partnerships</strong>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.
