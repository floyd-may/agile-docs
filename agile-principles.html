<h1>
  Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
</h1>

<p>
  <em>We follow these principles:</em>
  <br />
  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
  <br />
  through early and continuous delivery
  of valuable software.
</p>

<p>
  Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
  development. Agile processes harness change for 
  the customer's competitive advantage.
</p>

<p>
  Deliver working software frequently, from a 
  couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
  preference to the shorter timescale.
</p>

<p>
  Business people and developers must work 
  <br />
  together daily throughout the project.
</p>

<p>
  Build projects around motivated individuals. 
  <br />
  Give them the environment and support they need, 
  <br />
  and trust them to get the job done.
</p>

<p>
  The most efficient and effective method of 
  <br />
  conveying information to and within a development 
  <br />
  team is face-to-face conversation.
</p>

<p>
  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
</p>

<p>
  Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
  <br />
  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
  <br />
  to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
  Continuous attention to technical excellence 
  <br />
  and good design enhances agility.
</p>

<p>
  Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
  of work not done--is essential.
</p>

<p>
  The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
  <br />
  emerge from self-organizing teams.
</p>

<p>
  At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
  to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
  its behavior accordingly.
